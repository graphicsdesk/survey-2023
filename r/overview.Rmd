## Affirmative action

Support for affirmative action among Asians and whites peaks don't show too strongly of a trend , but it seems that higher-income students tend to not support affirmative action. But
```{r}
responses_race %>% 
  group_by(income, category) %>% 
  # filter(n() > 5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(income, fill = affirmative_action)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()
  facet_grid(category ~ .)
```

## Free speech

```{r}
responses_race %>% 
  ggplot(aes(free_speech)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Eliminate loans

```{r}
responses_race %>% 
  ggplot(aes(income, fill = eliminate_loans)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()
```
