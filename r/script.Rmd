zip_fips <- read.csv("ZIP-COUNTY-FIPS.csv")
```

## Preliminary looks

```{r}
responses <- fromJSON("../data/form_responses.json") %>% 
  separate(categories, sep = "; ", into = c("category1", "category2", "category3")) %>% 
  gather(category_num, category, category1:category3) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(category)) %>% 
  mutate(
    eliminate_loans = factor(eliminate_loans, levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly agree")),
    income = factor(income, levels = c("Less than $40K", "$40K to $80K", "$80K to $125K", "$125K to $250K", "$250K to $350K", "$350K to $500K", "Greater than $500K"))
  )

# School by income
responses %>%
  ggplot(aes(income, fill = category)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()

responses %>%
  ggplot(aes(school, fill = income)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip()

# Loans opinion by income
responses %>%
  ggplot(aes(income, fill = eliminate_loans)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("dodgerblue3", "dodgerblue", "gray", "firebrick1", "firebrick")) +
  coord_flip()
```

## Map data export shit

```{r}
responses_fips <- responses %>% 
  merge(zip_fips %>% select(ZIP, STCOUNTYFP) %>% rename(zipcode = ZIP), by = "zipcode") %>%
  rename(fips = STCOUNTYFP)

responses_fips %>% 
  group_by(fips) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  write.csv(file = "fips_counts.csv")  
```
